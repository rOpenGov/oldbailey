(L.) Matthew Skinner was indicted for  forging, and counteirfeting an order, for the payment of money, directed to Mess. Fuller, Baker, and Halford , to this purport: "October "2 l, 1768. Pay to Mr. James Brown , or "bearer, 15 l. 15 s. and 6 d. G. Humphrys." And for publishing the same, with intent to defraud William Saunders , October 22 .</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 2 On the 22d of October last, the prisoner came to my shop; I am a hosier  near Aldgate ; he told me, he was recommended to buy three or four dozen of house, of 23 or 24 s. a dozen, and that they were for a person at Berry, who did a great deal of business in my way, and if we used him well, he would be a good customer; he looked out five dozen, which came to 5 l. 6 s. I asked him, what name I should make the bill of parcels in; he said, his name was Robinson; he then presented a draft for 15 l. 15 s. and 6 d. and desired me to give him change. He said, it was the last draft he had. I was hesitating upon it, but he appearing to be a reputable country shop-keeper, I was inclinable to give him change, with this precaution, that as soon as I had given him change, which was a draft upon Sir Richard Glyn and Co. I intended to go immediately to know whether it was a good one. I gave him a draft upon Sir Richard for 10 l. 9 s. and 6 d. which with the 5 l. 6 s. made the money. I went to Mr. Fuller's, and found his bill was a bad one. Sir Richard Glyn 's house being but two doors from that, I got to Sir Richard Glyn 's four minutes before the prisoner came in. Skinner seeing me, he wanted to withdraw. He said, he would call again; they told him, he had better do his business now. He had my draft in his hand, and laid it on the counter. We went for a constable, and took him in custody. He said, he received it of one Gompy, and said, his own name was Jonathan Robinson , that he came to town about selling a horse, and that he could neither write nor read. We went before an Alderman on the Monday. ( This was Saturday evening.) He there acknowledged another fraud of this kind. He said, he came from Sheffield, and that he received it of one Gompy, at a house in Goodman's Fields. He said, he should be glad to have Gompy taken. John Vaughn. The first time I saw the prisoner, was at Sir Richard Glyn 's. I went along with him and Mr. Saunders, and Mr. Halford, to a tavern in the Poultry. He was asked his name. He said, it was Jonathan Robinson , and was lately come out of the country, I think, from Sheffield, and had the draft of one Gompy, a Jew, and that he himself could neither write nor read. That he had laid in Goodman's-Fields the night before, and had taken it there; that he had been in town but a few days; that he lodged, when he came to town, at the Three Nuns Inn, in White-Chapel, three or four nights, but had laid at the Fleece Goodman's-fields the night before; and that he came to town to dispose of a horse. But he was not consistent in the account that he gave of himself.</span>
